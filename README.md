#This project is my variation of online chat.

It was based on Adrian Hajdin's [code](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_chat_application), but during the refactor process the frontend part was rewritten almost completely. The backend was left without big changes.

This project has a lot of small UX details that are not taken into account by most such projects, such as focus on the input field when clicking inside the application, remembering the user's nickname, room, sounds of new messages, automatically expanding input field via shift + enter and so on.

You can see the final result [here](https://snelsi-chat.now.sh/).
